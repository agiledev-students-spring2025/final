# WNYU Data Management Project
## Project Description
An internal data management platform for [WNYU](https://wnyu.org/), the campus radio station for New York University. The platform will digitalize and centralize decades of data for WNYU, from personnel lists, tens of thousands of media, documents, archives, and more. While available to everyone, users will have different levels of access, from admin to regular staff to everyday users.

## Product Vision Statement
The WNYU Data Management Platform empowers its users to store and modify data for the campus radio station easily and efficiently, creating a library of records, past events, personnel, and much more that is accessible to everyone.

## History
The current General Manager of WNYU, also the founding member of our team, realized that the station lacks a centralized way to organize its information. The station maintains decades of data without a way to digitally log, update, and access their library. This project provided the perfect opportunity to develop a solution to this problem and as such, the WNYU Data Management Platform was born.
