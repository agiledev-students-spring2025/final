# 🌱 HydroForest   

## Project Overview  
HydroForest is a web app designed to help users track their daily water intake while making hydration a fun and rewarding experience. Every time a user logs a bottle of water, a virtual tree grows in their digital forest. Over time, consistent hydration leads to a thriving forest, encouraging users to build healthy habits through gamification.  

## Product Vision Statement  
**HydroForest transforms the habit of drinking water into an engaging and rewarding experience by allowing users to grow a virtual forest as they stay hydrated.**

## How It Works  
From an end-user perspective, HydroForest will:  
-  Allow users to log their daily water intake (e.g., one bottle = tree growth).
-  Visually represent progress through a growing virtual forest.  
-  Track historical hydration data to show trends over time.  
-  Gamify the experience with forest customization.  
-  Send reminders and notifications to encourage hydration.  

## Project History  
HydroForest was conceived as a Software Engineering course project, inspired by the challenge of maintaining consistent hydration habits. Recognizing that many people struggle with drinking enough water daily, our team wanted to create a fun and engaging solution that makes hydration more rewarding. 

The idea started as a brainstorming session among our team members, where we explored ways to encourage positive behavior through digital incentives. We decided on a virtual forest concept, where trees grow as users log their water intake!

Our team follows an **Agile approach**, focusing on building core functionality first and iterating over time to ensure an engaging and polished product by the semester’s end.
