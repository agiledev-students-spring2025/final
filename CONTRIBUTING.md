# Team Norms
## Team Values
- Constant communication and transparency on the progress of your tasks. Honesty is always good and reaching out for help only benefits the team.
- To get help reach out through discord or private dm including all those you think are relevant to the fix.
- Conflict resolution will be done first through chats as everyone is expected to respond promptly, but second through a meeting if the messaging is not allowing for a robust conversation. If a team member is falling behind it is the job of the scrum master to check in and see what's going on and how they can better the situation.
- Team members should respond to messages within a couple hours. If it is urgent we will use a direct tag so they know it's important.
## Sprint Cadence
Sprints are two weeks long but could vary a few days based on the size of the features we're implementing. The team will decide when to use extensions based on the workload and time it is taking to finish our goals.
## Standups
- We will have standups on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30 pm. They will be conducted on discord call and members will share their screens to show everyone what they've been up to and what holdups they may be having.
- Members who do not participate will be reported to management.
- Members who make no progress for two meetings and don't reach out for help will be reported to management.
## Coding Standards
- We will use visual studio code 
- Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed
- Pass tests before merging into main.
- If you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality.
# Git Workflow
- Always work in a branch
- Always pull before pushing or committing
- Small and frequent commits
- Keep branches on topic (don't do random fixes on a feature branch etc.)
- Try not to work on the same files at the same time
# How To Contribute
- Team members will be assigned tasks during sprint planning or during standup meetings and will have a list of items to contribute to the sprint.
- Team members will only help other members when asked to do so and won't try to implement features they're not assigned to.
- Contributions will be made both in code and in meetings
    - Ideas can be presented during sprint planning or added to the backlog after being presented to the team
    - Code will be contributed based on their assigned tasks
